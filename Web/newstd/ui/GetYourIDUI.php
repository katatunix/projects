		<p>Your UoG identity card shows that you are a UoG student. It is very important that you carry the card with you at all times as it allows you to access certain UoG buildings including the libraries, and UoGU (UoG Student Union) activities.</p>

		<p>The ID card is produced by Security Systems. Students will be shown where to have their ID cards produced immediately after they enrol. In order for Security Systems to produce your card, you will need to show them the Statement of Student Status you received when you enrolled and they will then produce your first ID card. Your photograph will be taken, so you do not need to bring a photo with you and the card will be produced while you wait.</p>

		<p>Security Systems are based in the Andrew Huxley Building. If you lose your ID card or it gets stolen please visit this office to get a replacement; there may be a charge for replacement cards. Further information on ID cards can be found on the Security Systems website.</p>
