		<p>You will be expected to pay at least 50% of your programme fees for the 2013/14 session as part of the enrolment process. The quickest and easiest way to pay your tuition fees is via Payonline, the UoG Online Payment Service or for alternative ways of making a payment you can view the UoG Invoices and Payments page. You (or someone paying on your behalf) can do this at any time after you have been invited to pre-enrol. If your fees payment is successful, you will receive a receipt via email with a unique order number.</p>

		<p>If you are an undergraduate student who has applied for funding from your Student Finance England/Wales (see the Directgov site for more information), Northern Ireland Library Boards or Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS), you do not have to pay your fees as these will be automatically paid to UoG. However, we recommend you make sure that you have applied for the full amount. Other students will need to either pay the fees directly to UoG or give us details of their sponsorship arrangement.</p>

		<p>All fee and funding related enquiries should be directed to the UoG Student Fees and Student Funding Offices, Room G19, South Wing (map ref C4).</p>

		<p><b>Budgeting</b></p>

		<p>In addition to your tuition fees you will also need to cover the basic costs such as accommodation, food and books. For more information concerning financial support and sources of funding please refer to our page on University Living.</p>

		<p><b>How much should I be paying?</b></p>

		<p>Details of current tuition fee rates for undergraduates can be found on the current students website. Graduate students should have the details about their fees on the offer letter. Further information about the cost of your programme and paying your fees can be found in the Money section of the current students site. If you have any queries about fees, please contact the Fees Office.</p>
